== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin sync orders or customers? =

No, this plugin focuses exclusively on product and category synchronization. It does not handle orders, customers, or other store data.

= What happens if products already exist in WooCommerce? =

The plugin uses intelligent matching to prevent duplicates:
1. First, it checks for existing items using stored Ecwid IDs
2. If no match is found, it attempts to match by SKU (products) or name (categories)
3. Existing items are updated with Ecwid data; new items are created if no match exists

= Are product variations supported? =

Yes, full variation support is included:
- Ecwid product options become WooCommerce attributes
- Option values become attribute terms (auto-created if missing)
- All combinations are created as WooCommerce variations
- Variation-specific data (SKU, price, stock, images) is preserved

= Can I sync only certain products? =

Absolutely! The **Product Sync** page allows you to:
- Load all available Ecwid products
- Select specific products for import
- Use "Select All/None" for bulk operations

= What about category hierarchies? =

Category parent-child relationships are fully preserved:

- Complex nested structures are supported

= Can I stop a sync in progress? =

Yes, all sync operations include a prominent **STOP SYNC** button that immediately halts the process and provides user feedback.

= How does the plugin handle large catalogs? =

The plugin uses advanced batch processing:
- Operations are performed in small chunks to prevent timeouts
- Memory usage is optimized for large datasets
- Progress tracking provides real-time updates
- Configurable batch sizes for different server capabilities

= What if my server has limitations? =

The plugin is designed to work within common hosting constraints:
- Batch processing prevents memory issues
- Configurable timeouts accommodate slower servers
- Error recovery handles temporary connection issues
- Detailed logging helps identify and resolve problems

= Are images synchronized? =

Yes, complete image synchronization is supported:
- Main product images
- Product gallery images
- Variation-specific images
- Automatic WordPress media library integration
